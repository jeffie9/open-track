# open-track

This project is at least the fourth iteration of a model train layout desiner that I have been working on for the last 20 or so years.
This version uses JavaFX 8 which is requiring a complete rewrite.

It's a typical Maven app, but so far, has few dependencies other than Java 8 and JavaFX SceneBuilder.

If you are reading this, then you should check out the latest earlier revision of designer-app which was written using Java Swing.

As of February 2018, this project only has a track element editor.  The layout editor and runner will be coming later.
